# Deep Neural Network from Scratch

## Contents

- A python file containing implementation of neural network from scratch 
- A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use the class

## Libraries Used

Our model uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Python library for data manipulation
- [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)-Programming language
### Note
> Here we have implemented binary classification(on breast cancer dataset as an example) if required you can tweak the architecture.
>There are three activations implemented relu,tanh and sigmoid if require you can add more.
>You will have to input activations and the number of hidden units of each layer in a list to train the model
